### üìå Prompt for a Commercial Figurine
This is a highly detailed prompt used to generate a realistic product shot of a figurine based on a reference image. It specifies scale, material, environment, and even packaging details, making it perfect for product visualization.  

**When to Use:** Use this when you need to visualize a product, such as a collectible, a toy, or a miniature model, in a realistic commercial setting.  

**Prompt:**  
"Using the nano-banana model, create a 1/7 scale commercialized figurine of the characters in the picture, in a realistic style, in a real environment. The figurine is placed on a computer desk. The figurine has a round transparent acrylic base, with no text on the base. The content on the computer screen is the Zbrush modeling process of this figurine. Next to the computer screen is a BANDAI-style toy packaging box printed with the original artwork. The packaging features two-dimensional flat illustrations. Please turn this photo into a figure. Behind it, there should be a Model packaging box with the character from this photo printed on it. In front of the box, on a round plastic base, place the figure version of the photo I gave you. I'd like the PVC material to be clearly represented. It would be even better if the background is indoors."
